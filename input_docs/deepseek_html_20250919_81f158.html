Dear [Client Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to you today regarding [Prospective Client Company Name], a company that I believe could benefit from our services, much like [Client Company Name] has.

Subject: Would you be willing to provide a referral for [Your Company Name]?

Dear [Client Name],

I hope you're doing well. We're currently in discussions with [Prospective Client Company Name] and they've asked for references from our current clients.

Given our productive collaboration on [Specific Project] and the [Specific Result] we achieved together, I thought you would be an ideal reference for our work.

Would you be open to either:
1. Providing a brief written testimonial we can share, or
2. Allowing them to contact you directly for a short conversation?

I completely understand if you're unable to assist at this time, but any support you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
